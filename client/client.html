    <p>Deduce Me is a Social Deduction game in the style of Mafia/Werewolf where every player has a power role, or a role that allows them to take actions or gain information. Players are assigned a role which is either good or evil. Good players aim to kill all of the evil players through use of their role actions or through executing them during a trial in the day. If the majority of the players accuse the same person during the day, that player will be voted on. Then, players can cast a vote for the accused being either executed or pardoned, or they can abstain from voting. If the majority of voting players choose to execute, the player is executed. After a vote, every player's vote is revealed. Evil players aim to equal or outnumber the good players through killing off good players, whether this be through role actions or through executing good players during votes. The game ends when either of these conditions are met, and the good or evil team wins.</p>

    <h3>Day Phases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Night: Players take their role actions at night. During night, talking is restricted. The Crier can speak with everyone at night, but they are the only good player who can talk. Evil players can talk freely, and only players who have an evil alignment will be able to see those messages.</li>
      <li>Day: Players can discuss and accuse others of being evil. If the majority of players accuse the same person with the !choose command, the accused player is voted on and phase shifts to Day Voting.</li>
      <li>Day Voting: Players vote on the accused player. The day ends 10 seconds after the results of the voting.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Commands</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>!choose displayName: This command chooses the player that you specify. During night time, this is used to choose that player to perform your role action on. During the day, this accuses that player of being evil.</li>
      <li>!execute: This command is used during the Day Voting phase to vote to execute the accused player.</li>
      <li>!pardon: This command is used during the Day Voting phase to vote to pardon the accused player.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Roles and Descriptions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Medic: Good, Can choose to visit at night to heal a player of poison, and also prevent them from dying that night</li>
      <li>The Investigator: Good, Can choose to visit a player at night to get the faction of the player (Good or Evil)</li>
      <li>The Follower: Good, Can choose to watch a person to see who they visit at night.</li>
      <li>The Observer: Good, Can choose to  watch a person to see who visits them at night.</li>
      <li>The Guardian: Good, Can shoose to protect a player. If that player is attacked, you are killed instead.</li>
      <li>The Knight: Good, Can choose to kill a player at night. If that player is good, you die instead.</li>
      <li>The Flirt: Good, Can choose to distract someone at night, stopping their night action</li>
      <li>The Vigilante: Good, One bullet, can choose to shoot someone at night (one use only)</li>
      <li>The Crier: Good, Can talk to all players at night but name is hidden</li>
      <li>The Assassin: Evil, Can choose to kill a player once a night</li>
      <li>The Chemist: Evil, Can choose to  poison a player. The player is notified of being poisoned and dies the next night if they are not healed before then</li>
      <li>The Informant: Evil, Can choose to get the specific role of a player</li>
    </ul>

    <em>Night Actions play out in this order</em>
    <p>The Flirt -> The Observer -> The Follower -> The Chemist -> The Medic -> The Guardian -> The Investigator -> The Informant -> The Assassin == The Vigilante == The Knight</p>

    <p>The chemist poisons before the medic heals. If the medic heals the player who is being poisoned, they are notified that they had been poisoned, but that they were healed of the poison. Kills from The Assassin, The Vigilante, and The Kinght, will happen at the same time, so even if one of these players dies the kill still happens.</p>

    <h3>Role Rules</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>There is always one Assassin. In a game of 6 or 7, the one evil player will always be an assassin</li>
      <li>There can only be one of each role</li>
      <li>In a game of 12, there will be one of each role</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Role Distribution (Based on total players)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>6 Players: 1 Evil, 5 good</li>
      <li>7 Players: 1 Evil, 6 good</li>
      <li>8 Players: 2 Evil, 6 good</li>
      <li>9 Players: 2 Evil, 7 good</li>
      <li>10 Players: 2 Evil, 8 good</li>
      <li>11 Players: 3 Evil, 8 good</li>
      <li>12 Players: 3 Evil, 9 good</li>
    </ul>
